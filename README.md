# Note Taker App

## Description

I wanted to create an application that can be used to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete. I wanted this application to use an Express.js back-end and wanted it to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. I wanted the app to feature a landing page with a link that would take the user to a notes page and when a user clicks the link they are then presented with a page with existing notes plus an empty field to enter a new note. I wanted the the app to feature a 'save note' button, a 'new note' button and a 'clear form' button so a user is able to create multiple notes for multiple tasks quickly and easily. Overall this app is dynamic and interactive as the buttons switch out. NPM packages!!!
